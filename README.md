Program in C

// currently untested, will need testing later, but for now I'll call it done. 

//Algorithm basically uses a series of step changes over time rather than trying to optimize all at once. it starts with a default of 1/7 step size, and then multiplies by 2 each time. 

//this way it covers a wide area first and then keeps covering a more refined version of a wider and wider area. it might be best to have many structs that have the 10 or so largest values instead of just the largest.
